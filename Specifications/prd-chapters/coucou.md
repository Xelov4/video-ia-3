read the md files present in the prd-chapters folder first, it is the initial intention document. 
and only then audit the full codebase in order to say : 
What has been done
What do we have to do in order of priority
What has been done wrong or could be improved
What files are not relevant anymore or outdated. 
Are there any incoherences ?
Create a new md file named audit_1247.md with all your insights and conclusion, add a very detailed and long to do list that lists all the things we need to do from now to delivery 100%

these files have numbers but it is not a priority rank, please go through everything and then think deeply, very deeply for this audit and your conclusions.
